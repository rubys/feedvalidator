<p>While this date-time value is formatted correctly, it either appears to be
in the future, or far enough in the past to indicate that there might either be a software error, or an incorrectly set clock, involved.</p>
<p>While the RSS 2.0 spec
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltpubdategtSubelementOfLtitemgt">anticipated</a>
that some aggregators may chose to ignore items with pubDates in the future,
this practice
<a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile-1#element-channel-item-pubdate">never seemed to catch on</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, many clients sort by dates, either by default, or as an option.  For this reason, it is important that date values are as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>One common error, particularly among the British and Western Europe during the summer time (i.e., during the periods of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time">BST and WEST</a>), is for the numeric part of the time to reflect local time and for the zone part of the time to hard code GMT.</p>

<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that RSS 2.0 pubDate and atom:updated and atom:published elements are as accurate as possible.</p>
