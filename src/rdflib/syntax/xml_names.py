# From: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-CombiningChar
#
# * Name start characters must have one of the categories Ll, Lu, Lo,
#   Lt, Nl.
#
# * Name characters other than Name-start characters must have one of
#   the categories Mc, Me, Mn, Lm, or Nd.
#
# * Characters in the compatibility area (i.e. with character code
#   greater than #xF900 and less than #xFFFE) are not allowed in XML
#   names.
#
# * Characters which have a font or compatibility decomposition
#   (i.e. those with a "compatibility formatting tag" in field 5 of the
#   database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a "<") are not allowed.
#
# * The following characters are treated as name-start characters rather
#   than name characters, because the property file classifies them as
#   Alphabetic: [#x02BB-#x02C1], #x0559, #x06E5, #x06E6.
#
# * Characters #x20DD-#x20E0 are excluded (in accordance with Unicode
#   2.0, section 5.14).
#
# * Character #x00B7 is classified as an extender, because the property
#   list so identifies it.
#
# * Character #x0387 is added as a name character, because #x00B7 is its
#   canonical equivalent.
#
# * Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters.
#
# * Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters.
